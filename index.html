A small guide to climbing Half Dome in Yosemite National Park, CA.</h3>

<p>Hiking up Half Dome is well worth the trek for the view alone:<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d6/Half_Dome_from_Glacier_Point,_Yosemite_NP_-_Diliff.jpg" alt="Half Dome"></p>

<p>Rising nearly 5,000 feet above Yosemite Valley and 8,800 feet above sea level, Half Dome is a Yosemite icon and a great challenge to many hikers. Despite an 1865 report declaring that it was "perfectly inaccessible, being probably the only one of the prominent points about the Yosemite which never has been, and never will be, trodden by human foot," George Anderson reached the summit in 1875, in the process laying the predecessor to today's cable route.</p>

<p>The most famous--or infamous--part of the hike is the ascent up the cables. The two metal cables allow hikers to climb the last 400 feet to the summit without rock climbing equipment. Relatively few people have fallen and died on the cables, but injuries are not uncommon so be careful out there! Check the gear list below for everything you need and keep a hold on the cables!</p>

<a id="gear-list" class="anchor" href="#gear-list" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Gear List</h2>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Footwear</p>

<ul>
<li>Bring well broken-in boots with good ankle support and good traction. Some of the most common injuries Half Dome hikers suffer are blisters and ankle injuries; good footwear is the best way to prevent these problems.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Gloves</p>

<ul>
<li>Many people find gloves helpful on the cables. However, if you bring your gloves up, pack them out. Hundreds of pounds of rotting gloves otherwise accumulate.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Trash</p>

<ul>
<li>There is no trash service on trails. While hiking in Yosemite, be sure to pack out all trash. When possible, you can help park rangers by picking up trash that you encounter on the trail. Bearproof trash cans are available at trailheads.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Water</p>

<ul>
<li>One of the easiest ways to ensure a safe, enjoyable hike is to be sure to have plenty of water. Weather conditions and personal preference affect the amount of water you need, but suggested minimum amounts per person are:</li>
<li>1 gallon (4 liters) if hiking to the top of Half Dome</li>
<li>2 quarts (2 liters) if hiking only to the top of Nevada Fall</li>
<li>1 quart (1 liter) if hiking only to the top of Vernal Fall</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Other stuff</p>

<ul>
<li>Fork</li>
<li>Knife</li>
